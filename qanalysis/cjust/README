
Program POLYBIF:

	Full-Information Item Bi-factor Analysis for Ordinal Response Data

New Features:

	1. Items can load on the primary dimension only
	2. Zero can be a valid category if izero=1
	3. Missing data are coded as zero unless izero=1
	4. Adaptive ridge added to correct divergence when likelihood decreases
	5. Prior for slopes added
	6. Different numbers of item categories are permitted
	7. Both the rating scale model a(j)*theta+b(j)+d(k) 
	   and the full graded model a(j)*theta+b(j,k) are included
        8. Items can me deleted within the program (select IMISS=1 (new field)
           and do not list in domains).
        9. Scoring of sub-domains.

Release Notes:  To run with previous def files, add IMISS (0 or 1) to the 
                end of line 3.

Indices:

	l refers to response pattern  (l = 1, ... , nor)
   	s refers to subtest           (s = 2, ... , h) 
	j refers to item              (j = 1, ... , n)
        js refers to item in subset s (js = 1, ... , ns)
        q refers to quad point        (q = 1, ... , m)
	t1 refers to category         (t1 = 1, ... , ncat(j))


Definitions:

	n             number of items
	t	      maximum number of categories 		
	h             number of factors
	ns(s),s=2,h   number of items loading on each subfactor
	nor           number of response patterns
	nit           number of iterations
	uni           1 = unidimensional model else 2 = bifactor
	iscr          1 = EAP ability estimates in file *.scr
	ifreq         1 = patterns and frequency else patterns only
	izero	      1 = zero is a valid category else zero is missing
	iprior	      1 = prior else no prior
	rating        1 = rating scale model else full graded model
	imiss         1 = items not in domains deleted, else primary only

Notes: 

	1. If izero=1 there can be no missing data
	2. If rating=1 and number of item categories vary over items,
           rating is set to 0 (ie. the rating scale model is only for 
	   items with the same number of categories).
	3. If IMISS=1 and an item is not in the subdomain list, it will not
           be included in the analysis.  This allows different subsets of 
           items to be used without recreating the datafile and/or modifying 
           the format statement.
	4. A common error is failing to include the line in the def file that
           specifies the maximum number of categories for each item.  Note that
           this line is in the same format as the data and can often be 
           confused for one of the actual data records.
        5. In general, the prior is not required.
        6. There are no longer any restictions on number of factors, items,
           subdomains, ...

Format of input file (*.def):

	1. title1

	2. title2

	3. n,t,h,(ns(s),s=2,h),nor,nit,uni,iscr,ifreq,izero,iprior,rating,imiss

        4. If (iprior.eq.1) read prior mean(s) and sd(s)

		if(iprior.eq.1.and.uni.eq.1) then 
			mean, sd
	   	elseif(iprior.eq.1.and.uni.eq.2) then
			mean1, mean2, sd1, sd2	
	  	 endif	

	5. Read items that load on each of the h-1 subdimensions

		item(2,js),js=1,ns(2)
		item(3,js),js=1,ns(3)
		    .
		    .
		    .
		item(h,js),js=1,ns(h)

	6. Input data format (integer) statement 
		
		if(ifreq.eq.0)then for example:
			(26i1)
		elseif(ifreq.eq.1)
			(26i1,f4.0)
		endif

	7. number of categories per item (in format described in 6.)
		
		ncat(j),j=1,n

	8. Read nor data records using format in 6
		
		if(ifreq.eq.1)then
			do l=1,nor
	 		  (orth(l,j),j=1,n),r(l)
			enddo
		else
			do l=1,nor
	 		  (orth(l,j),j=1,n)
			enddo
		endif

To Run:

	Open a DOS window

	Go to the directory where the program and def file are located
        (e.g., CD \POLYBIF)

	Type POLYBIF FILENAME at the DOS prompt

		where FILENAME is the name of the input file described 
		above with the extension DEF (eg. to run TEST1.DEF, 
                enter POLYBIF TEST1 at the DOS prompt). 

	Output is stored in FILNAME.OUT

	Bayes estimates of latent variable scores (Primary and each of the h-1
        subdomains) are in FILENAME.SCR, 2 lines per subject.  The first line
        contains the h scores (e.g., abilities or impairment scores) and the 
	second line contains the standard errors (posterior standard 
        deviations).
